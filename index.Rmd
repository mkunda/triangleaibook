Welcome to the Triangle AI Book!  This book provides a broad introduction to artificial intelligence, dotted with musings on cognitive science, society, technology, and the human condition.

```{marginfigure}
If you are primarily interested in the parts of AI that have to do with data science, neural networks, and statistical machine learning, you may get more traction out of more specialized resources like [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Rob Tibshirani; or [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.  (See [Other Resources](#sec:resources) for more ideas.)
```

If you want to learn about the basic science of AI, and how we can use AI to understand and model different kinds of intelligences, then you will likely find something to enjoy in these pages.  

The material is similar to what is covered in a typical intro AI course in an undergraduate CS program, but with a few twists.  This book assumes undergraduate-level familiarity with coding, algorithms, probability, and calculus.

I am an assistant professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University.  I do research in AI and cognitive science, with a focus on visuospatial reasoning, human learning, and autism and other forms of neurodiversity.  My [research lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab) is part of the School of Engineering at Vanderbilt University, and we are also affiliated with Vanderbilt's [Frist Center for Autism and Innovation](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/autismandinnovation/).

I belong to a research community within AI called [cognitive systems](https://www.cogsys.org/) (like other communities for computer vision, robotics, natural language processing, etc.).  Cognitive systems researchers tend to think about intelligence in terms of two components: knowledge representations and reasoning processes---an idea that we will return to later in this book.

My trajectory as an AI person began when I was a math major at MIT, where I worked on path planning research with [Nick Roy](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/index.php?n=Main.HomePage) and also took my first AI courses with [Patrick Winston](https://people.csail.mit.edu/phw/).  I then did a PhD in computer science at Georgia Tech, working on cognitive systems research with [Ashok Goel](https://dilab.gatech.edu/ashok-k-goel/), followed by a postdoc also at Georgia Tech with [Jim Rehg](https://rehg.org/), where I meandered into computer vision and machine learning.  I have been a CS faculty member at Vanderbilt since 2016.

[Patrick Henry Winston (1943-2019):](https://www.memoriesofpatrickwinston.com/remembrances) A teacher, mentor, and friend who captured my imagination long ago when he would pace around the front of the classroom and exclaim, "In AI, we are working to unlock the mysteries of the human mind!"
```

This book is also greatly inspired by the memory and teachings of [Patrick Winston](https://people.csail.mit.edu/phw/), longtime AI professor at MIT and one of my most cherished mentors.  Back in the day, I took his [6.034](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/) intro AI course and his [6xxx](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/index.html) course on "The Human Intelligence Enterprise," and I also enjoyed learning from his vast store of wisdom about communication, much of which is collected in his final book [*Make It Clear*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/make-it-clear).

(Back in the spring of 2019, Patrick sent me a publisher's proof of this book, which at the time was titled simply *Communication*.  As I was carrying it from my office to my car, I started idly flipping through the first few pages.  Before I knew it, I found myself sitting on a random bench in the shadow of Vanderbilt's football stadium for the next 2.5 hours to finish reading it!  Patrick's writings, like his lectures, were always captivating.)

```{marginfigure}
"Skill building and big ideas."  From [Lecture 1](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/resources/lecture-1-introduction-and-scope/) in Patrick's 6.034 course.
```

Patrick often began his courses by talking about how he wanted to give students experience not just in "skill building" but also in the "big ideas" that form the really interesting intellectual foundations of a discipline.  This book aims to do just that.  While many AI books will help you build the same sorts of skills we'll be talking about here (search algorithms, heuristic techniques, and so on), the Triangle AI Book situates these skills in the context of big ideas about artificial intelligence, human intelligence, and our ongoing quest to "unlock the mysteries of the human mind."

I love Tufte-style marginalia!  We will have lots of these throughout this book.
```

```{marginfigure}
If you've never heard of Edward Tufte, he is a pioneer of visual communication and design, especially around the visualization of data.  His books (beginning with his now-classic [*The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)) are both thought-provoking and gorgeous, and bear his signature look of ultra-spacious margins dotted with [all](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be) [kinds](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei) of notes, figures, and tangents.  In fact, Tufte chose to self-publish his books so that he could have full control over the design, and it shows.
```

```{marginfigure}
I also cannot mention Tufte without repeating one of my favorite quotations of all time, in which he describes Powerpoint data graphics as "poking a finger into the eye of thought."  (From his 2003 diatribe on why [Powerpoint Is Evil](https://www.wired.com/2003/09/ppt2/).)  No, this has nothing to do with the rest of this book, but it's hilarious, and hey, that's what marginalia are for!
```

I learned many lessons about structure and format from other free online textbooks, including [*Neural Networks and Deep Learning*](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen; [*Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau (and the accompanying [blog post](http://from-a-to-remzi.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-case-for-free-online-books-fobs.html) about open access textbooks); [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund; and [*Modern Statistics for Modern Biology*](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/index.html) by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber.
